<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project serves to be a central hub for me to record my memories from my travels.

Having visited Taiwan and Australia, I find myself missing some moments from the carefree days and when I want to revisit, I'd have to go through my gallery to find the photos and it was a troublesome process. With Globewalker, I can upload the best moments from my travels onto this website and look at them easily anytime, anywhere.
